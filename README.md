# MarketDataCollector
"MarketDataCollector" is a GitHub repository that provides users with four different methods for retrieving financial time series data.

Financial time series provide an excellent platform for training and testing different models, yet obtaining high-quality market data can be challenging. 
This repository offers the code I used to retrieve financial market data using four different providers: IG Market, Alpha Vantage, iexAPI, and Yahoo Finance. 
By utilizing this code, you can gain inspiration and modify it to accommodate complex requests.
